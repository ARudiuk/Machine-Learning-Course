Machine-Learning-Course
=======================

Code created for Machine Learning course

ANN.py is the foundation of the code as it is called to create the artificial neural network. By knowing the right parameters it can be adapted for different kinds of tasks. I'll probably add descriptions later, but if you look into the code the name of the parameters are pretty descriptive.

For the auto-associative network and an example of a single layered perceptron look in the Multilayer Percepetron folder.
